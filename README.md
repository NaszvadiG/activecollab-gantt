activecollab-gantt
==================

A better Gantt Chart for activeCollab 4.

## How to Setup ##
Basically, all you need to do to set this up is create a folder in your activeCollab installation called `gantt` in the following directory (for example):

    /path/to/your/install/custom/modules/

Then, you can install it like any other module in activeCollab. This module *does* create its own tables, since it needs them to save your filter preferences. If you uninstall the module, you **will** lose your saved fields.
